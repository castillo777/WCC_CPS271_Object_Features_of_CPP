A frequency table lists words and the number of times each word appears in a text file. Write a program that creates a frequency table for a file whose name is entered by the user.  You may want to use the function ispunct(), in header file ctype.h, to check for punctuation so you can strip it off the end of a word. Use exceptions to handle file errors. Try to make a class to read and write files.
